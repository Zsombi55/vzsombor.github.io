Online Public CV Website (work in progress)

This website acts as both a personal online Curriculum Vitae as well as a portfolio of my experience with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Development started at the beginning of the Web Development course I am attending.
I will work on it, improving and adding to expand it as needed and as I learn new things that I feen are fitting in such a system.

All portfolio-relevant works will be found on GitHub under the name of Zsombi55.


Thank you for visiting!  :)
